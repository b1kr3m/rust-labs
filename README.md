# 🦀 Rust Labs

Welcome to **Rust Labs**, a hands-on learning lab for the Rust programming language.  
This repository contains practical code examples, topic-wise experiments, mini-projects, and personal notes from my journey into systems programming with Rust.

## 📌 Goals

- ✅ Learn Rust from the ground up
- 🧠 Understand memory safety, ownership & lifetimes
- 🧪 Build small, working programs with `cargo`
- 📘 Document learning through notes and code
- 🚀 Use this repo as a reference and portfolio

---

## 🚧 Work in Progress

This repo follows my study of:

- 📖 [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
- 💡 [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings)
- 📺 YouTube tutorials and official documentation

Expect incremental additions and improvements as I go deeper into the language.
